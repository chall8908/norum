This is a simple, me screwing around on a Friday kinda project. The goal is to write a simple piece of forum software, initially, then add some funky features like automatically updating threads and other fancy real-time features.

The application is built using Node.js on the back-end, using MongoDB as a storage engine. The software will initially be built as a simple RESTful webservice, in which the templates are rendered on the clientside. This should ensure a simple and fast back-end.
