Keeping it light, lean, and without too much management overhead, this file
contains a list of user stories, their status, and a list of tasks associated
with those. Done tasks and stories are marked with an X. Stories and tasks
will be ordered (and re-ordered) according to their priority and dependence
on each other. Done stories will be ordered in the order they've been completed.
Todo stories will be at the top, done at the bottom.
